creator.py 

 
This module will create 512MB EC2 instances.  
The script will ask for the user to enter the number of instances he wants to create. It will create them and print their private IP addresses. 

The instances will follow these specifications: 

Their name will be "web<instance's serial number>". For example, the first instance's name will be "web1", the second's name will be "web2" and so on. 

Their image will be Linux 2. 

User data will be used to run an Apache server on each instance. The user data should be read from a file you will create: "user-data.sh".  

The user will be able to access each web server at the page "index.html", that will present a sentence of your choice. Reminder: Do not forget to open the relevant ports! You can use an existing security group for that purpose. 

Each instance will have a "date" tag (in a format of your choice), which will contain the date the instance was created on. 

The following specifications will not be determined in the code but in the file "configuration.txt". Its structure is as follows: 

instance-type: <value> 
key-name: <value> 
image-id: <value> 
security-group: <value> 

<value> will be replaced with the value of this field. For example: 

instance-type: t3.nano

You may assume that the file's structure is permanent and that there are no missing values.  
After executing this module, you should see on AWS the new instances, and be able to connect them.
